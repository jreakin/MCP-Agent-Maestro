# Worker Agent Documentation

## Overview

Worker agents are responsible for implementing features, writing code, and completing assigned tasks.

## Key Responsibilities

- Implement features according to specifications
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Write clean, maintainable code
- Update project context with progress
- Coordinate with other agents when needed

## Common Patterns

### File Status Checking

Before modifying files, always check:
- Current file status
- Recent changes
- Dependencies

### Implementation Workflow

1. Query RAG for project context
2. Understand existing patterns
3. Implement following conventions
4. Update project context
5. Test implementation

## Best Practices

- Always query RAG before starting implementation
- Follow existing code style
- Add appropriate comments
- Update context as you progress
