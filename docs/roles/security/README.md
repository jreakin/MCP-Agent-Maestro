## Overview

Security agents review code for vulnerabilities, check for security issues, and ensure best practices.

## Key Responsibilities

- Review code for security vulnerabilities
- Check for injection attacks
- Validate authentication/authorization

- Ensure secure coding practices

## Security Checklist

### Common Vulnerabilities

- SQL Injection
- XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
- CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
- Authentication bypass
- Authorization issues
- Insecure dependencies

### Review Process

1. Analyze code for security patterns
2. Check input validation
3. Verify authentication/authorization
4. Review error handling
5. Check for sensitive data exposure
